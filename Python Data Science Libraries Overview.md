## Python Data Science Libraries Overview

### 1. Scientific Computing Libraries

**Pandas** - Provides data structures and tools for data manipulation and analysis, with its primary instrument being the DataFrame (a two-dimensional table with column and row labels) designed for easy indexing.

**NumPy** - Uses arrays for inputs and outputs, can be extended to matrix objects, and enables fast array processing with minor coding changes.

**SciPy** - Includes functions for advanced mathematical problems and data visualization capabilities.

### 2. Visualization Libraries

**Matplotlib** - The most well-known library for creating highly customizable graphs and plots.

**Seaborn** - A high-level visualization library built on Matplotlib that makes it easy to generate various plot types including heat maps, time series, and violin plots.

### 3. Algorithmic (Machine Learning) Libraries

**Scikit-learn** - Contains tools for statistical modeling including regression, classification, and clustering, built on NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib.

**Statsmodels** - A module that allows users to explore data, estimate statistical models, and perform statistical tests.
